This program takes in from the user a series of decimal numbers or hex values and either adds, subtracts, or multiplies all the numbers from left to right. It will also mod or divide the first two argv values. Lastly, it will print out the values in reverse order e.g. 1 3 56 -> 65 3 1, this program will also make use of a function dispatch table to call functions to eliminate pushing function calls onto the stack.
